# My Credo

## In Regard To Self

### Responsibility
- defend your individual rights:
  - do not allow others to harm you or your dependents
  - do not allow others to manipulate your property without invitation

### Respect
- always respect yourself:
  - do not pander to others
  - do not treat others injustly or with prejudice

### Growth
- keep an open mind
- continue the persuit of knowledge throughout your life
- do not speak out of turn
- listen 80%, talk 20%
- understand what rights you have and what priveledges you have been bestowed, and most importantly, clearly understand the distinction

## In Regard To Others

### Rights
- do not infringe on the individual rights of others:
  - do nothing that would harm them
  - do nothing that would affect their property without their permission

### Groups / Organizations / Political Parties
- do not support groups or organizations that compromise any of these principles
- do not support groups that garner support through compromise
- do not cast your support along party lines
- support individuals that uphold these principles

## Truth
- Hold truth dear, seek it out in everything you do
- Hold yourself to be truthful
- Hold those in your spheres of influence to be truthful
- Instill the importance of truth in your dependents
- Seek to understand the true meaning of things, and only then come to a decision

## Spheres of Influence in Order of Importance
1. Self
2. Family
3. Kin, Friends
4. Local Government
5. State Government
6. National Government

Never prioritize the rights of and your responsibilities to one sphere above the rights of and your responsibilities to a higher-ranking sphere.
