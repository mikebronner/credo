# My Credo

## In Regard To Self

### Responsibility
- defend your individual rights:
  - do not allow others to harm you or your dependents
  - do not allow others to manipulate your property without invitation

### Respect
- always respect yourself:
  - do not pander to others
  - do not treat others unjustly or with prejudice

### Growth
- keep an open mind
- continue the pursuit of knowledge throughout your life
- do not speak out of turn
- listen 80%, talk 20%
- understand what rights you have and what privileges you have been bestowed, and most importantly, clearly understand the distinction

## In Regard To Others

### Rights
- do not infringe on the individual rights of others:
  - do nothing that would harm them
  - do nothing that would affect their property without their permission

### Groups / Organizations / Political Parties
- do not support groups or organizations that compromise any of these principles
- do not support groups that garner support through compromising of values (not in the sense of coming to agreement, needs clarification)
- do not cast your support along party lines
- support individuals that uphold these principles

## Truth
- Hold truth dear: seek it out in everything you do
- Require yourself to be truthful
- Require those in your spheres of influence to be truthful
- Instill the importance of truth in your dependents
- Seek to understand the true meaning of things, and only then come to a decision

## Spheres of Influence in Order of Importance
1. Self
2. Family
3. Kin, Friends
4. Local Government
5. State Government
6. National Government

Never prioritize the rights of and your responsibilities to one sphere above the rights of and your responsibilities to a higher-ranking sphere.

### Notes to be organized
- honor your father and mother in everything you do ("thou hast forgotten the face of your father!" -Stephen King, The Dark Towers). Consider the Oath of the Gunslinger, consider it beyond its superficial meaning. At the core of it all it means to live honestly, truthfully, and considerately.
  >I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I aim with my eye.
  >
  >I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I shoot with my mind.
  >
  >I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I kill with my heart.
- act in ways that won't cause regret (with what you know when making the decision, is it the best possible decision)
- treat each individual with respect.
- consider each individual as a person driven by needs, fears, and ambitions.
- recognize each individual for the person they are:
  - recognize their good deeds
  - recognize their bad deeds
  - recognize honesty
  - recognize dishonesty
- when confronting an issue where someone asks something of you that you don't believe in, explain the business impact it will have. If other party still insists, concede to making a temporary exception, with the goal of figuring out a proper solution afterwards by scheduling a meeting NOW for developing the a proper solution together.
  - If it's outside of a business relationship, just say no.
- try to identify commonalities with peers (instead of differences) in an effort to reach the common goals. Agree to set aside differences. Remind yourself what the commonalities and your dreams are. Will achieving the common goals help you reach your dreams? If not, recuse yourself from the group.
- happiness is achieved when your goals and behavior align
  - compare behavior, action, effort to your wants, desires, goals
  - you need to be clear on what you goals are, so that you can alwys make adjustments in your behavior, action, effort, so that you can achieve them.
