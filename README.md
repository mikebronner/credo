# My Credo

## In Regard To Self

### Responsibility
- defend your individual rights:
  - do not allow others to harm you or your dependents
  - do not allow others to manipulate your property without invitation

### Respect
- always respect yourself:
  - do not pander to others
  - do not treat others unjustly or with prejudice

### Growth
- keep an open mind
- continue the pursuit of knowledge throughout your life
- do not speak out of turn
- listen 80%, talk 20%
- understand what rights you have and what privileges you have been bestowed, and most importantly, clearly understand the distinction

### Success
- always strive to be the best at what you do
- finish everything and anything you start
- never stop learning
- never loose the beginner's mindset (shoshin). remember, we don't really know anything.
- surround yourself with others that are more successful than you
- obsess over reaching your goals

## In Regard To Others

### Rights
- do not infringe on the individual rights of others:
  - do nothing that would harm them
  - do nothing that would affect their property without their permission

### Groups / Organizations / Political Parties
- do not support groups or organizations that compromise any of these principles
- do not support groups that garner support through compromising of values (not in the sense of coming to agreement, needs clarification)
- do not cast your support along party lines
- support individuals that uphold these principles

## Giving
- offer your help, assistance, or time to your friends, family, relationships, and business aquaintances
- do not expect anything in return
- if you notice that a specific recipient is being entitled and always demanding more without reciprocating, do not continue giving to them
- this will open doors for you in unexpected ways
- TBA: create a definition of things you should and shouldn't give. For example, giving away your professional services when you can't afford to

## Truth
- Hold truth dear: seek it out in everything you do
- Require yourself to be truthful
- Require those in your spheres of influence to be truthful
- Instill the importance of truth in your dependents
- Seek to understand the true meaning of things, and only then come to a decision

### Falacies
Understand and recognize falacies when you encounter them. Fallacies can be either illegitimate arguments or irrelevant points, and are often identified because they lack evidence that supports their claim. (These are taken from https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/logic_in_argumentative_writing/fallacies.html for the time being, until I can rewrite them in my own words, so I don't forget.)

#### Slippery Slope
This is a conclusion based on the premise that if A happens, then eventually through a series of small steps, through B, C,..., X, Y, Z will happen, too, basically equating A and Z. So, if we don't want Z to occur, A must not be allowed to occur either.
> If we ban Hummers because they are bad for the environment eventually the government will ban all cars, so we should not ban Hummers.

In this example, the author is equating banning Hummers with banning all cars, which is not the same thing.

#### Hasty Generalization
This is a conclusion based on insufficient or biased evidence. In other words, you are rushing to a conclusion before you have all the relevant facts.
> Even though it's only the first day, I can tell this is going to be a boring course.

In this example, the author is basing his evaluation of the entire course on only the first day, which is notoriously boring and full of housekeeping tasks for most courses. To make a fair and reasonable evaluation the author must attend not one but several classes, and possibly even examine the textbook, talk to the professor, or talk to others who have previously finished the course in order to have sufficient evidence to base a conclusion on.

#### Post hoc ergo propter hoc
This is a conclusion that assumes that if 'A' occurred after 'B' then 'B' must have caused 'A.'
> I drank bottled water and now I am sick, so the water must have made me sick.

In this example, the author assumes that if one event chronologically follows another the first event must have caused the second. But the illness could have been caused by the burrito the night before, a flu bug that had been working on the body for days, or a chemical spill across campus. There is no reason, without more evidence, to assume the water caused the person to be sick.

#### Genetic Fallacy
This conclusion is based on an argument that the origins of a person, idea, institute, or theory determine its character, nature, or worth.
> The Volkswagen Beetle is an evil car because it was originally designed by Hitler's army.

In this example the author is equating the character of a car with the character of the people who built the car. However, the two are not inherently related.

#### Begging the Claim
The conclusion that the writer should prove is validated within the claim.
> Filthy and polluting coal should be banned.
Arguing that coal pollutes the earth and thus should be banned would be logical. But the very conclusion that should be proved, that coal causes enough pollution to warrant banning its use, is already assumed in the claim by referring to it as "filthy and polluting."

#### Circular Argument
This restates the argument rather than actually proving it.
> George Bush is a good communicator because he speaks effectively.

In this example, the conclusion that Bush is a "good communicator" and the evidence used to prove it "he speaks effectively" are basically the same idea. Specific evidence such as using everyday language, breaking down complex problems, or illustrating his points with humorous stories would be needed to prove either half of the sentence.

#### Either/or
This is a conclusion that oversimplifies the argument by reducing it to only two sides or choices.
> We can either stop using cars or destroy the earth.

In this example, the two choices are presented as the only options, yet the author ignores a range of choices in between such as developing cleaner technology, car-sharing systems for necessities and emergencies, or better community planning to discourage daily driving.

#### Ad hominem
This is an attack on the character of a person rather than his or her opinions or arguments.
> Green Peace's strategies aren't effective because they are all dirty, lazy hippies.

In this example, the author doesn't even name particular strategies Green Peace has suggested, much less evaluate those strategies on their merits. Instead, the author attacks the characters of the individuals in the group.

#### Ad populum/Bandwagon Appeal
This is an appeal that presents what most people, or a group of people think, in order to persuade one to think the same way. Getting on the bandwagon is one such instance of an ad populum appeal.
> If you were a true American you would support the rights of people to choose whatever vehicle they want.

In this example, the author equates being a "true American," a concept that people want to be associated with, particularly in a time of war, with allowing people to buy any vehicle they want even though there is no inherent connection between the two.

#### Red Herring
This is a diversionary tactic that avoids the key issues, often by avoiding opposing arguments rather than addressing them.
> The level of mercury in seafood may be unsafe, but what will fishers do to support their families?

In this example, the author switches the discussion away from the safety of the food and talks instead about an economic issue, the livelihood of those catching fish. While one issue may affect the other it does not mean we should ignore possible safety issues because of possible economic consequences to a few individuals.

#### Straw Man
This move oversimplifies an opponent's viewpoint and then attacks that hollow argument.
> People who don't support the proposed state minimum wage increase hate the poor.

In this example, the author attributes the worst possible motive to an opponent's position. In reality, however, the opposition probably has more complex and sympathetic arguments to support their point. By not addressing those arguments, the author is not treating the opposition with respect or refuting their position.

#### Moral Equivalence
This fallacy compares minor misdeeds with major atrocities, suggesting that both are equally immoral.
> That parking attendant who gave me a ticket is as bad as Hitler.

In this example, the author is comparing the relatively harmless actions of a person doing their job with the horrific actions of Hitler. This comparison is unfair and inaccurate.

## Spheres of Influence in Order of Importance
1. Self
2. Family
3. Kin, Friends
4. Local Government
5. State Government
6. National Government

Never prioritize the rights of and your responsibilities to one sphere above the rights of and your responsibilities to a higher-ranking sphere.

### Notes to be organized
- honor your father and mother in everything you do ("thou hast forgotten the face of your father!" -Stephen King, The Dark Towers). Consider the Oath of the Gunslinger, consider it beyond its superficial meaning. At the core of it all it means to live honestly, truthfully, and considerately.
  >I do not aim with my hand; he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I aim with my eye.
  >
  >I do not shoot with my hand; he who shoots with his hand has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I shoot with my mind.
  >
  >I do not kill with my gun; he who kills with his gun has forgotten the face of his father.
  >I kill with my heart.
- act in ways that won't cause regret (with what you know when making the decision, is it the best possible decision)
- treat each individual with respect.
- consider each individual as a person driven by needs, fears, and ambitions.
- recognize each individual for the person they are:
  - recognize their good deeds
  - recognize their bad deeds
  - recognize honesty
  - recognize dishonesty
- when confronting an issue where someone asks something of you that you don't believe in, explain the business impact it will have. If other party still insists, concede to making a temporary exception, with the goal of figuring out a proper solution afterwards by scheduling a meeting NOW for developing the a proper solution together.
  - If it's outside of a business relationship, just say no.
- try to identify commonalities with peers (instead of differences) in an effort to reach the common goals. Agree to set aside differences. Remind yourself what the commonalities and your dreams are. Will achieving the common goals help you reach your dreams? If not, recuse yourself from the group.
- happiness is achieved when your goals and behavior align
  - compare behavior, action, effort to your wants, desires, goals
  - you need to be clear on what you goals are, so that you can alwys make adjustments in your behavior, action, effort, so that you can achieve them.
- always tell the truth. it will not inconvenience you as long as you are truthful. it will expose thise who do not tell the truth for what they are. if you had considered them your friends, the truth will set you free. Truth demands people take responsibility.
